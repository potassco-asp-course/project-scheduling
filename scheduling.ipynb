    "The task of this project is to solve two scheduling problems in ASP:\n",

    "\n",
    "In both problems there are ``j`` jobs and ``m`` machines.\n",
    "We refer to the machines with numbers from ``1`` to ``m``.\n",
    "Every job consists of ``m`` operations\n",
    "that have to be performed in a given sequence.\n",
    "Each operation uses one machine during a given time, and\n",
    "we refer to each operation of a job with the number of the machine that it uses.\n",
    "A machine can only process one operation at a time, and\n",
    "some operations may have to wait until their corresponding machine is free.\n",
    "Different operations of the same job use different machines, and\n",
    "the operations of each single job use all machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Permutation Flow Shop problem:\n",
    "* the operations of every job must be processed in the sequence ``1``, ..., ``m``, and\n",
    "* the processing order of the jobs on the machines is the same for every machine.\n",
